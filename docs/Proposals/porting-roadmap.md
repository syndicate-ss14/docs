# Porting Roadmap

Backporting PRs from our microcosms to the Macrocosm repository can happen for many reasons, but are usually one of two:

1. The feature is desired by multiple microcosms
2. The feature is an extreme maintenance burden

*(You can read more about these reasons on our [Voting](../Conventions/voting.md) page.)*

This page exists to streamline the process of backporting by creating a list of PRs that exist on microcosms which fit one of these two criteria. It serves as a reference for:

- The kinds of PRs that Macrocosm would like to see backported / that players and developers are interested in
- Whether PRs that are desired on Macrocosm have existing licensing or conceptual approval in advance
- A to-do list of PRs people can work on
- A showcase of the cool features created by our microcosms!

**This is not a formal voting page.** Not every PR in this list has implicit conceptual or code approval from all microcosms. Even if a PR is listed as being approved by all microcosms, it will still require a formal vote before being merged.

If you wish to add a PR to this list, please open a PR on our [docs repository](https://github.com/syndicate-ss14/docs)!
<!-- mq note: might be cool to set up a little bot or something that can also auto-open issues for this. having that done could even be used AS a formal vote. thats a whole process. but really anything to streamline devstuffs ya know -->
